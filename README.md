# HoneyComb-Python-Environment

## Overview
This repository contains a simple implementation of a Python environment reflecting the HoneyComb paradigm.
It is primarily intended to be used in reinforcement learning and thus conforms to the `gmy.env` interface

## Usage
First install the necessary packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then see `honeycomb_env.py` for an example of how to use the environment.
The demo can be executed using:
```
python honeycomy_env.py
```
